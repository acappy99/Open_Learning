# Open Learning

This project is about learning in the open. My background is finance and my experience with computer science is minimal. As I learn, I will document my journey here, which may help someone else on their journey. I believe learning programming in this fashion will allow me to reflect on my abilities, get help, and become proficent at GitHub.

In this repository are my resources, courses, notes, exercises, and projects. For frequent reference, some roadmaps are included:
