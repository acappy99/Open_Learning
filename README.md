# Open Learning

This project is about learning in the open. I am a master's of finance student captivated by FinTech, data, and blockchain technologies. Although I have experience with Python, I want to dive deeper in addition to learning databases, algorithims, and backend development. I plan on documenting my learning journey here, which may potential help others in my situation. Additionally, I hope this project allows me to become profficent at version control and collaboration.

## Organization of this project

Each language I am learning is contained in a folder, including a README.md for tasks and progress, quick references for that language, and import notes. Within each language folder will contain folders for course notes, exercises, and projects. Sometimes some special folders and documents will be created for various needs.
